# Simpily converts html to markdown
Just a simple project I wrote in golang to convert html to markdown, surprisingly works decent for a lot of websites. Can be piped into something like [lowdown](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/) to convert html into a man page, troff ms(which can further be converted into pdf or ps using something like groff), or just whatever you like.
# Usage
``
html2md -i file.html
``
